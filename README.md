VSTeam is a PowerShell module with commands for accessing your Azure DevOps Server (previously named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server) 2017/2018 and Azure DevOps (previously named Visual Studio Team Services).

The VSTeam module is also a provider allowing users to navigate their Azure DevOps Server and Azure DevOps as a file system.
